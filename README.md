# Spyglass

**Fast, keyboard-driven search popup for VS Code** — inspired by [Neovim Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) and JetBrains Search Everywhere.

Open with `Ctrl+Alt+F`. Type. Navigate. Done.

## Customizing Keybindings

### Change the open shortcut

Open **Keyboard Shortcuts** (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`), search for `Spyglass: Open Search` and assign your preferred key.

Or edit `keybindings.json` directly (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → *Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)*):

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+f",
    "command": "spyglass.open",
    "when": "!inputFocus || editorTextFocus"
  }
]
```

### Change shortcuts inside the panel

Add to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "spyglass.keybindings.navigateDown": "j",
  "spyglass.keybindings.navigateUp": "k",
  "spyglass.keybindings.toggleRegex": "ctrl+r",
  "spyglass.keybindings.togglePreview": "ctrl+p"
}
```

---

## Vim Setup

If you use the [VSCode Vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim), you can bind `<Space>f` as your Spyglass shortcut — just like Telescope in Neovim.

Add to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive": [
    {
      "before": ["<Space>", "f"],
      "commands": ["spyglass.open"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Then disable the default `Ctrl+Alt+F` binding if you prefer to use only the Vim shortcut:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+f",
    "command": "-spyglass.open"
  }
]
```

## Requirements

- VS Code `^1.85.0`
- No additional dependencies — ripgrep is bundled automatically
- Git (optional) — required for change indicators in the preview panel
- A language server extension (optional) — required for the **Symbols** scope
